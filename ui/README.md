# Computer Science and Maths

This website allows students to explore the various data structures and algorithms that they will
learn during Secondary Education in Computer Science and Maths.

The actual implementations of the algorithms can be found in the [Computer Science Maths Library](https://github.com/JoeSharp/comp-sci-maths-lib) repository. This contains TypeScript implementations of all the algorithms for utility by students in Node applications or in other web interfaces.

## Running Locally
