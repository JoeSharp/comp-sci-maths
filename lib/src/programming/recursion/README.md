# Recursion

This package contains a couple of algorithms implemented in Recursive style, and using a simple loop.

There are tests for both versions of the function to prove that they both yield the same results.

## Factorial

This is implemented using the following techniques
 * Recursing down from 'x' to '1'
 * Looping a multiplication from 1 to 'x'

The unit tests then determine that both functions behave the same, which do you prefer?
