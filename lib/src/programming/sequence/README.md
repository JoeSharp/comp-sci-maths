# Sequence

Code statements are executed in a specific order. Generally code is executed from top to bottom.

JavaScript programs behave this way, but it is typical for code statements to register 'callback handlers' with slow running processes.

JavaScript's origins in the browser led it to be highly 'asynchronous' to prevent websites from grinding to a halt.

## Interval Demo

Run the intervalDemo using
